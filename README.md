# Project Description:

## Description:
I initiated this project to allow users to store and showcase their documents directly from their server. Although the original idea was to code an inline HTML newsletter, a client expressed the need to add a link at the end of the page to redirect readers to external content while avoiding the use of a third-party application. This project aims to provide a simple and standalone solution to meet this requirement, thereby allowing everyone to share their documents online.

## Steps:
1. Clone the project from GitHub.
2. Use `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Copy the entire folder to your server.
4. Run the `server-expose.js` file (you can use pm2 to do this).
5. Configure your domain name, if applicable.
6. You can now display all files present in the "files" directory on your server. Bingo!
